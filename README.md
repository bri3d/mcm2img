# Use

python3 mcm2img.py mcmfile.mcm font.bin [rawfmt] [R] [G] [B]
eg : python3 mcm2img.py betaflight.mcm font.bin RGBA 0 255 0 for green font colour

mcmfile.mcm file can found at
X:\BetaFlight\betaflight-configurator-installer_10.7.0_win32\resources\osd\1


if rawfmt is specified, it's one of the (many) raw bitmap formats supported by Pillow: https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/blob/main/src/libImaging/Unpack.c#L1483 . RGBA is probably the most common thing you will want here.
